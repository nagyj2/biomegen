# pipeline/

Ordered generation stages that fill an immutable `World`. `pipeline/__init__.py` (`generate`) owns the order.

## Rules

- A stage is `run(world, config, seed) -> None`. It reads only fields produced by earlier stages and writes
  only its own; there is no backtracking.
- One rng label per stage (a stage may add sub-labels, e.g. `rng.derive(seed, "terrain", "warp")`). First
  labels must be in `util.rng.LABELS`; add new ones there, never ad-hoc strings. Streams come from `rng.derive*`, never
  `random` or `numpy.random` seeded by hand, never builtin `hash()`.
- Iterate collections in a defined order (`sorted()`); dict and set order is not a contract.
- Every tunable comes from `config.get(...)`, not a literal (see `config/CLAUDE.md`).
- Folders say what a stage models: `physical/` (land and water), `civilization/` (roads), `story/` (POI
  content). Flat modules still to be reorganised stay in `pipeline/` until the phase that replaces them.

## Adding a stage

1. Create the module with `run(...)`, add its label to `LABELS`, call it in `generate()` at the right point.
2. Add a test under `tests/pipeline/` mirroring the module, plus a stats entry if it adds countable output.
3. Update the stage list in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4. Run `scripts/fingerprint.sh` before and after and explain every change.
